Until I encountered The Lifehack Ultimate Transformation I was against life coaching, because I believe people should deduce how to live in their own unique way. However, The Lifehack Ultimate Transformation doesn't only teach me WHAT to do, but HOW to think. The article that impressed me the most before subscribing to the course is "Do you understand happiness", which suggests to stop pursuing happiness, and turn "suffering" into a spark. A framework of thought like this can be a game changer in life.
